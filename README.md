### 👋 About Me

I'm James, a software engineer and product builder who likes working at the intersection of **product thinking** and **hands-on engineering**. The kind of work where you're talking to users in the morning and pushing code in the afternoon.

Currently a **Technical Product Manager at [Tempo Labs](https://www.tempolabs.ai/) (YC23)**, where I manage $700K+ in ARR, build internal tooling used across the company, and deploy multi-agent orchestration systems with Claude-powered sub-agents. Before that I was shipping AI-powered features at **Flowmatic**, building analytics tools used daily at **Zynga** (Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells, Words With Friends 2), and plugging AI micro-services into CRMs at **Repwave**.
